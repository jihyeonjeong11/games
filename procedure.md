1. Initial Setup
   Define Canvas Size: Make sure your canvas dynamically adjusts based on the window size (you've already started this).
   Game Loop: Set up a requestAnimationFrame loop for rendering frames and updating game logic.
   Coordinate System: Use a grid-based approach for the game world, as rogue-likes often involve tiled maps.
2. Create Game Elements
   Tile Map:

Define a 2D array where each cell represents a tile (e.g., floor, wall, treasure, etc.).
Render this grid onto the canvas.
Player Character:

Add a player object with properties like position (x, y), health, and inventory.
Draw the player sprite or a simple rectangle/circle to start.
Enemies and NPCs:

Create enemy objects with basic AI (e.g., random movement or following the player).
Items and Obstacles:

Include collectible items like potions, weapons, or keys.
Add walls or other obstacles to create the dungeon layout. 3. Handle Input
Keyboard Controls:
Capture arrow keys, WASD, or other input to move the player.
Update the player's position on the grid and re-render the scene.
javascript
Copy
Edit
window.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
switch (event.key) {
case 'ArrowUp': // Move player up
case 'ArrowDown': // Move player down
case 'ArrowLeft': // Move player left
case 'ArrowRight': // Move player right
break;
}
}); 4. Game Loop
Use the requestAnimationFrame method for smooth rendering:

javascript
Copy
Edit
function gameLoop() {
updateGameState(); // Update player, enemies, etc.
renderGame(); // Draw the game elements onto the canvas
requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop); // Continue the loop
}
gameLoop(); 5. Procedural Generation (Optional)
Rogue-like games often feature procedurally generated levels:
Write a function to generate dungeon layouts with rooms, corridors, and random placements of enemies and items. 6. Add Mechanics
Combat:
Allow player attacks, and add turn-based mechanics or real-time interactions with enemies.
Health and Inventory:
Track player health, manage items, and create effects (e.g., health potions).
Win/Loss Conditions:
Define conditions for winning (e.g., reaching the exit) or losing (e.g., running out of health). 7. Polish
Graphics:
Start with simple shapes, then replace them with sprites (e.g., .png images).
Sound Effects:
Add audio for attacks, item pickups, and movement.
UI:
Display health, score, inventory, etc., outside the canvas or overlaying it.
Tools and Resources
Tile Graphics: Look into free sprite sheets for dungeon tiles and characters (e.g., OpenGameArt, itch.io).
Game Logic: Focus on a turn-based system or a real-time loop depending on your preference.
Library (Optional): Use game libraries like Phaser if you want to simplify some tasks, though pure Canvas is also great for learning.
